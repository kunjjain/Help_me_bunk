## How it works

The extension scans your attendance page for the pattern **"X of Y hours attended"** inside each subject card, then computes:

| Formula | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `(0.85 × total − attended) / 0.15` | Classes needed to hit 85% |
| `attended / 0.85 − total` | Classes you can skip |

---

## Troubleshooting

**Panel shows "No subject data found"**
- Make sure you're on the **Course Overview** tab (not Daily Log)
- Try refreshing the page after the tab loads fully

**Wrong subject names showing**
- The extension picks the first bold text inside each card
- If your portal uses different HTML, open `content.js` and adjust the `name` selector on line ~38

## Changing the target %

Open `content.js` and change line 4:
```js
const TARGET = 85; // change to 75 or whatever your college requires
```
